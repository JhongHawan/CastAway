                                Of the thousands of refugees looking for resettlement less than 1% are referred. The first step of the process includes them registering with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Once they have registered, the UNHCR can refer them for resettlement. Part of the process involves an assessment by the UNHCR and a background check. The ones that are given a green light are determined to not pose a security risk to the United States and can move forward with the vetting process.
